Its purpose is to set the appropriate <code>hostname</code> and <code>/etc/hosts</code> configuration on the hosting OS in preparation of SAP installation

# Role's tasks:

2. Add hostname to cloud.cfg file
3. Register own hostname to /etc/hosts file

# Available variables:

## How to use

On your main <code>.yml</code> file add:

Example 1 - adding other hosts to <code>/etc/hosts</code> file: 

```
- name: Set hostname
  become: yes
  hosts: all
  roles:
    - role: set-hostname
      vars:
        extra_vars_to_add_to_hosts:
          - private_ip: "172.0.0.1"
